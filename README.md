# Artifical_Neural_Network

# An "Artificial neural network" depends on a bunch of related units or hubs called pseudo neurons. Pseudo neurons by and large model the neurons of the regular brain. Like the normal synapses of the psyche, every affiliation can label various neurons. “Artificial neurons” can get as well as deal with banners and send messages to related neurons. The related "signal" is genuine and the outcome for every is not entirely set in stone by the inconsistent number of criticism bits. Affiliations are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have loads that change as learning advances. The heap increments or diminishes the sign strength of the affiliation. The client can draw a neuron line to guarantee that characters are sent precisely when the quantity of characters surpasses this edge. Neurons are normally gathered in layers. Various layers permit the user to roll out various improvements to the data. The user’s personality might go through layers often previously moving from the principal# layer (input layer) to the last layer (yield layer).In this report, there will be a description of the chosen dataset. After that, the experiment will be demonstrated in this report along with numerous snips that were collected during the work in google colab.
